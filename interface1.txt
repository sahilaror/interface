ANS 1 
	interface is just like  class with difference that all the method in interface are by default public and abstract 
	and all the variable in the interface are by default final and static. and we can't create the object of interface class 
        An interface in Java is a mechanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of
	class that contains only constants and abstract methods.


ANS 2
	Only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.

ANS 3
	There are many reasons to use interfaces in java. They are as follows:

	 1. An interface is used to achieve full abstraction.
	 2. Using interfaces is the best way to expose our projectâ€™s API to some other project.
	 3. By using interface, we can achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance.

ANS 4

	ABSTRACT CLASS							|				INTERFACE
									|
1	In abstract class we have abstract as well as nonabstract	| 1. In interface we have only abstract method

2.	abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance		| 2. interface support multiple inheritance

3.	child class use extends keyword to extends the abstract class 	| 3. child class use implements keywords to implements the behaviour and property of interface class
									|
4.	abstract class provide the implementation of interface		| 4. interface class doesn't provide the implemenation of abstract class
